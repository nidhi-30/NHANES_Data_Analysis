This project is aimed to investigate and analyze various data mining techniques for prediction of frequent chronic diseases in U.S. adults who participated in 2017-2018 NHANES dataset. The main focus is on using Hybrid AI Model to estimate the association among all the features of NHANES dataset and classify hypertension diseased participants. This paper utilized a highly imbalanced dataset of 8366 with 81.20% participants with no hypertension, and 18.80\% participants with hypertension. Our results shows the best accuracy of 94% with Hybrid AI model which can be contributed to the health domain in identifying the person with risk of having hypertension by taking all the health prospects into the consideration.
